# Code Review and Quality

## Overview

Multi-dimensional code review with quality gates. Every change gets reviewed before merge — no exceptions. Review covers five axes: correctness, readability, architecture, security, and performance.

**The approval standard:** Approve a change when it definitely improves overall code health, even if it isn't perfect. Perfect code doesn't exist — the goal is continuous improvement. Don't block a change because it isn't exactly how you would have written it. If it improves the codebase and follows the project's conventions, approve it.

## When to Use

- Before merging any PR or change
- After completing a feature implementation
- When another agent or model produced code you need to evaluate
- When refactoring existing code
- After any bug fix (review both the fix and the regression test)

## The Five-Axis Review

Every review evaluates code across these dimensions:

### 1. Correctness

Does the code do what it claims to do?

- Does it match the spec or task requirements?
- Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values)?
- Are error paths handled (not just the happy path)?
- Does it pass all tests? Are the tests actually testing the right things?
- Are there off-by-one errors, race conditions, or state inconsistencies?

### 2. Readability & Simplicity

Can another engineer (or agent) understand this code without the author explaining it?

- Are names descriptive and consistent with project conventions? (No `temp`, `data`, `result` without context)
- Is the control flow straightforward (avoid nested ternaries, deep callbacks)?
- Is the code organized logically (related code grouped, clear module boundaries)?
- Are there any "clever" tricks that should be simplified?
- **Could this be done in fewer lines?** (1000 lines where 100 suffice is a failure)
- **Are abstractions earning their complexity?** (Don't generalize until the third use case)
- Would comments help clarify non-obvious intent? (But don't comment obvious code.)
- Are there dead code artifacts: no-op variables, backwards-compat shims, or `// removed` comments?

### 3. Architecture

Does the change fit the system's design?

- Does it follow existing patterns or introduce a new one? If new, is it justified?
- Does it maintain clean module boundaries?
- Is there code duplication that should be shared?
- Are dependencies flowing in the right direction (no circular dependencies)?
- Is the abstraction level appropriate (not over-engineered, not too coupled)?

### 4. Security

Does the change introduce vulnerabilities?

- Is user input validated and sanitized?
- Are secrets kept out of code, logs, and version control?
- Is authentication/authorization checked where needed?
- Are SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- Are outputs encoded to prevent XSS?
- Are dependencies from trusted sources with no known vulnerabilities?
- Is data from external sources treated as untrusted?

### 5. Performance

Does the change introduce performance problems?

- Any N+1 query patterns?
- Any unbounded loops or unconstrained data fetching?
- Any synchronous operations that should be async?
- Any unnecessary re-renders in UI components?
- Any missing pagination on list endpoints?
- Any large objects created in hot paths?

For detailed profiling and optimization → load `performance-optimization` skill.

## Change Sizing

```
~100 lines changed   → Good. Reviewable in one sitting.
~300 lines changed   → Acceptable if it's a single logical change.
~1000 lines changed  → Too large. Split it.
```

**Splitting strategies:**

| Strategy | How | When |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Stack** | Submit a small change, start the next one based on it | Sequential dependencies |
| **By file group** | Separate changes for groups needing different reviewers | Cross-cutting concerns |
| **Horizontal** | Create shared code/stubs first, then consumers | Layered architecture |
| **Vertical** | Break into smaller full-stack slices of the feature | Feature work |

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A change that refactors existing code and adds new behavior is two changes — submit them separately.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand the Context

```
- What is this change trying to accomplish?
- What spec or task does it implement?
- What is the expected behavior change?
```

### Step 2: Review the Tests First

```
- Do tests exist for the change?
- Do they test behavior (not implementation details)?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Would the tests catch a regression if the code changed?
```

### Step 3: Review the Implementation

Walk through the code with the five axes in mind.

### Step 4: Categorize Findings

| Prefix | Meaning | Author Action |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| *(no prefix)* | Required change | Must address before merge |
| **Critical:** | Blocks merge | Security vulnerability, data loss, broken functionality |
| **Nit:** | Minor, optional | Author may ignore |
| **Optional:** / **Consider:** | Suggestion | Worth considering but not required |
| **FYI** | Informational only | No action needed |

### Step 5: Verify the Verification

```
- What tests were run?
- Did the build pass?
- Was the change tested manually?
```

- [ ] **Request changes** — Issues must be addressed
```

## Honesty in Review

- **Don't rubber-stamp.** "LGTM" without evidence of review helps no one.
- **Don't soften real issues.** "This might be a minor concern" when it's a bug is dishonest.
- **Quantify problems when possible.** "This N+1 query will add ~50ms per item" is better than "this could be slow."
- **Push back on approaches with clear problems.** Sycophancy is a failure mode in reviews.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works, that's good enough" | Working code that's unreadable, insecure, or architecturally wrong creates debt that compounds. |
| "I wrote it, so I know it's correct" | Authors are blind to their own assumptions. |
| "We'll clean it up later" | Later never comes. The review is the quality gate — use it. |
| "AI-generated code is probably fine" | AI code needs more scrutiny, not less. It's confident and plausible, even when wrong. |
| "The tests pass, so it's good" | Tests don't catch architecture problems, security issues, or readability concerns. |

## Red Flags

- PRs merged without any review
- "LGTM" without evidence of actual review
- Security-sensitive changes without security-focused review
- Large PRs that are "too big to review properly"
- No regression tests with bug fix PRs
- Accepting "I'll fix it later"

## Verification

- [ ] All Critical issues are resolved
- [ ] All Important issues are resolved or explicitly deferred with justification
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] The verification story is documented
